A twtxt client for Emacs

* Install

** Melpa

~twtxt~ is available from
Melpa. After [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][setting up]] Melpa
as a repository and update the local package list, you can install
~twtxt~ and its dependencies using ~M-x package-install twtxt~.

** Manually

Add twtxt to your ~load-path~ and require. Something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/twtxt/")
  (require 'twtxt)
#+END_SRC

* Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq twtxt-file "~/my/twtxt") ;; Path to twtxt file. Default "~/twtxt"

    ;; List following
    (setq twtxt-following '(("alice" "https://example.org/alice.txt")
  			     ("bob" "http://bobsplace.xyz/twtxt")))
#+END_SRC

** Optional: Using the Post-Tweet Hook

You can use the ~twtxt-post-tweet-hook~ to perform additional actions automatically after posting a tweet. For example, you can upload your twtxt file to a server or execute other commands. Configure it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Example: Upload twtxt file to a remote server using scp: scp twtxt.txt user@server:/your/path/twtxt.txt
  (add-hook 'twtxt-post-tweet-hook (lambda () (call-process-shell-command (format "scp %s %s"
  									 twtxt-file
  									 "user@server:/your/path/twtxt.txt"
  									 ) nil 0)))
#+END_SRC

This example uploads your twtxt file to a remote server using ~scp~ after every tweet you post.

* Usage

~M-x twtxt-timeline~
