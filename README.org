~twtxt.el~ is a twtxt client for Emacs.

You can publish posts, view your follower timeline, read and reply to threads, view profiles, see when you are mentioned and write direct messages.

You will not need to use the official terminal client or other complex solutions to interact with the community. Where you go with Emacs, you go with twtxt.

- Publish posts (twts).
- Read chronologically the publications of those you follow.
- Notifications of mentions.
- Read and write in threads.
- Write secret messages (direct messages).
- View profiles.
- Mention, and notify, other users.
- Transform Markdown syntax to Org.

* Install

** Melpa

~twtxt~ is available from
Melpa. After [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][setting up]] Melpa
as a repository and update the local package list, you can install
~twtxt~ and its dependencies using ~M-x package-install twtxt~.

** Manually

Add twtxt to your ~load-path~ and require. Something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/twtxt/")
  (require 'twtxt)
#+END_SRC

* Setup

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq twtxt-file "~/my/twtxt") ;; Path to twtxt file. Default "~/twtxt"
#+END_SRC

If you don't have a twtxt file yet, you can create one using this template:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# Learn more about twtxt:
#     https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
#
# nick = Foo
# url = https://example.org/twtxt.txt
# avatar = https://example.org/avatar.jpg
# description = I'm a hacker
#+END_SRC

* Manage followers

You should add your followers to the ~twtxt-file~.

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# Learn more about twtxt:
#     https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
#
# nick = Foo
#
# ...
#
# follower = user https://example.org/twtxt.txt
# follower = user2 https://example-2.org/twtxt.txt
#+END_SRC

You can read more about the ~threads~ specification in the [[https://twtxt.dev/#mentions-and-threads][extension]].

* Replies

Optionally, if you want to replicate a post, you need to install the following unix tools:

- ~b2sum~
- ~awk~
- ~xxd~
- ~base32~
- ~tr~
- ~tail~

Otherwise you will only be able to replicate existing threads, not create them.

You can read more about the ~follower~ specification in the [[https://twtxt.dev/exts/metadata.html#follow][extension]].

* Markdown to org

If you have ~pandoc~ installed, ~twtxt.el~ will convert the markdown to org mode.

* Usage

Open the timeline buffer with ~M-x twtxt-timeline~.

Post a tweet with ~M-x twtxt-post~.

* Optional configuration

Set the twtxts per page:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq twtxt--twtxts-per-page 10)
#+END_SRC

* Hooks

You can use the following hooks to perform additional actions automatically:

| Name | Description |
|------|------------|
| ~twtxt-mode-hook~  | Hook run after enabling ~twtxt-mode~. |
| ~twtxt-post-tweet-hook~ | Hook run after posting a tweet. |
| ~twtxt-after-fetch-posts-hook~ | Hook run after fetching posts. |

For example, upload your twtxt file to a server or execute other commands. Configure it as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Example: Upload twtxt file to a remote server using scp: scp twtxt.txt user@server:/your/path/twtxt.txt
  (add-hook 'twtxt-post-tweet-hook (lambda () (call-process-shell-command (format "scp %s %s"
  									 twtxt-file
  									 "user@server:/your/path/twtxt.txt"
  									 ) nil 0)))
#+END_SRC

Or maybe you want to disable the spell checker:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'twtxt-mode-hook (lambda () (flyspell-mode -1)))
#+END_SRC

* It's slow when I open the timeline

If you have a lot of followers, fetching posts can be slow. The client is full of optimizations to remedy this, such as asynchronous fetching, avatar caching, calculations that are performed only when the data is being viewed, and other tricks. Unfortunately, Emacs has to perform time-consuming tasks such as sorting and interface construction. These tasks depend on your computing power.

If you want to improve speed you will have to:

- Reduce the number of followers.
- Reduce the number of posts per page.

I hope you can improve the performance. Enjoy!
