;;; Commentary:

;; twtxt is a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers.

;; You want to get some thoughts out on the internet in a convenient and
;; slick way while also following the gibberish of others? Instead of
;; signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting
;; your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a
;; publicly accessible text file.  The URL pointing to this file is your
;; identity, your account.  twtxt then tracks these text files, like a
;; feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on
;; which files you track.  The format is simple, human readable, and
;; integrates well with UNIX command line utilities.
